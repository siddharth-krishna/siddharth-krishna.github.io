## Dynamic Programming

### Word Processing

Recall, the problem: you are given $n$ words, of lengths $l_1, l_2, \dotsc, l_n$, and you need to arrange them into a paragraph where each line can fit up to $M$ characters, while minimizing the cost of the arrangement.
The cost of a given arrangement of words is the sum of the cubes of the number of extra spaces at the end of each line.
We can assume that each word fits in the line, i.e. $l_i \leq M$.
Let's see how to compute the minimal cost.

Let $c_i$ be the minimal cost of arranging words $i, i+1, \dotsc, n$ in a paragraph where each line has length $M$.
We break down the problem by looking at the first line of the optimal arrangement, which contains words $i, i+1, \dotsc, j$.
The rest of the lines will contain the optimal arrangement of words $j+1, \dotsc, n$ (Exercise: prove this using a cut & paste argument).
So we define $c_i$ as follows:
$$ c_i =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if $i > n$ (base case: no words left)} \\
\min_{i \leq j \leq n} (cost(i, j) + c_{j+1}) & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}$$

Here, $cost(i, j)$ is the cost of putting words $i, \dotsc, j$ on a line, i.e. the cube of the number of extra spaces at the end.
Since we have to put 1 space between every two words (so $(j-i)$ spaces in total), the line has length $\sum_{k = i}^j l_k + (j-i)$, so we can define $cost(i, j)$ by:
$$ cost(i, j) =
\begin{cases}
\infty & \text{if } \sum_{k = i}^j l_k + (j-i) > M \text{ (base case: words don't fit)} \\
(M - \sum_{k = i}^j l_k - (j-i))^3 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}$$
Note: if the problem specifies that we don't need to count the extra spaces on the last line in the cost, then we can easily modify this to add another case where $cost(i, j) = 0$ if $j = n$.

The final answer is $c_1$, and this can be computed either by memoization on $c$ or bottom-up by computing the values of $c_i$ starting at $n$ and working down.
Since each $c_i$ depends on a linear number of other $c_j$s, and $cost(i, j)$ can be computed in O(1) if we do some smart linear time pre-processing (Exercise: how?), the total running time is $O(n^2)$.
