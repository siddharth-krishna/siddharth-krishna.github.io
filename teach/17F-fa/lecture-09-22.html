## Quick sort

[VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting) has a nice visual explanation of all the main sorting algorithms.

http://me.dt.in.th/page/Quicksort/ has a nice explanation of quick sort. However, note that this page (and also VisAlgo) uses the *first* element of the array to partition it.

Hoare's original quick sort algorithm used a different partition algorithm (see Problem 7-1 of CLRS).
[Here](http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/animation/web/QuickSortPartition.html) is an animation that shows the partitioning as done by this algorithm.

## Towers of Hanoi

See the wikipedia page [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) for a description of the problem.
We saw a solution that uses $2^n - 1$ moves to move $n$ discs from the tower A to C.

Exercise: prove that this solution is optimal.

Challenge: can you find the *maximum* number of moves you can make to move $n$ discs from tower A to tower C, without going through a state (i.e. an arrangement of discs on towers) that you've previously been through?
