## Exercise 1

```java
public abstract class Animal {
        void defaultBehavior() {
                System.out.println("eat");
        }
        
        abstract void defaultDiet();
}
```

```java
public interface Locomotion {
        public void runsOn();
}
```

```java
public class Deer extends Animal implements Locomotion {
        public void runsOn() {
                System.out.println("legs");
        }
        
        void defaultBehavior() {
                System.out.println("eat; avoid being eaten");
        }
        
        void defaultDiet() {
                System.out.println("leaves");
        }
}
```

```java
public class Car implements Locomotion{
        public void runsOn() {
                System.out.println("wheels");
        }
}
```

### Questions

1. Comment the methods in `Deer.java`, one at a time. What happens?
2. Make the `defaultDiet()` method in `Animal.java` not abstract. What happens?
3. Make the class `Animal` in `Animal.java` not abstract. What happens?
4. Can a class inherit from more than one class in Java?
5. Why is `Locomotion`, in this example, implemented as interface, not as abstract class (like `Animal`)?

## Exercise 2

```java
        static int recsum(int n) {
                if (n == 0) {
                        return 0;
                } else {
                        int recSum = recsum(n-1);
                        return n+recSum;
                }
        }
```

How many times in total is `recsum` called for `n = 4`? For general `n`?

### Answer

Recsum is called 5 times (counting the initial call to `recsum(4)`) for `n = 4`. In general, `recsum(n)` results in `n + 1` calls.

### Fibonacci numbers

Aho Lymonk sat in his monastery atop a hill. To reach the village at the bottom, he had to go down `n` steps. Since Aho did this climb every day, and was bored out of his mind, he decided to make things interesting. The steps were such that Aho could either take a small step and go down one step, or if he stretched his legs and took a big step, he could go down two. Thus, if there were 3 steps to his monastery, he could go down them in 3 ways:
```
small step, small step, small step
small step, big step
big step, small step
```

How many ways can he climb down `n` steps?

### Answer

Let `f(n)` be the number of ways to climb down `n` steps. We saw that `f(3) = 3`. It is also easy to see that `f(0) = f(1) = 1` (if you accept the rather pointless statement that there's only 1 way to go down 0 steps). Now, imagine Aho sitting on the top of the flight of `n` stairs, about to go down. His first step can either be a small step, or a big step.

 - If his first step is a small one, then he has `n - 1` steps to go down still. The number of ways of going down `n - 1` steps is `f(n - 1)`.
 - If he takes a big step first, then he will have `n - 2` steps to go down. There are `f(n - 2)` ways of going down these remaining steps.

Since he does either of the two options above, his total possible ways of going down must be the sum of the ways in each option. Thus,
```
f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)
```

These numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...) are called [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

### Question

Write code to calculate `f(n)`.

### Answer

```java
static int f(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    else if (n == 1) return 1;
    else {
        return f(n-1) + f(n-2);
    }
}
```

### Question

How many times is `f` called for `n = 4`? For general `n`?

### Answer

Including the original call, there are 9 calls to `f` when `f(4)` is called.

In general, since `f(n)` needs the result of both `f(n - 1)` and `f(n - 2)`, the number of calls made by `f(n)` is the sum of the number of calls made by `f(n - 1)` and `f(n - 2)`. If we call the number of calls to `f` (including the original) when `f(n)` is called as `h(n)`, then this means that
```
h(n) = h(n - 1) + h(n - 2) + 1
```

(the `+ 1` is to count the original call to `f(n)`). Looks familiar? This is very similar to the Fibonacci numbers. In fact, `h(n) >= f(n)` for every `n`.

One can show that `f(n)` is approximately equal to `phi^n`, where `phi` is the golden ratio (1.618...). This means that `f(n)` grows exponentially in `n`. In other words, calculating the Fibonacci numbers with the above piece of code is a bad idea.

A smarter way to compute `f(n)` would be to store the values of `f(1), f(2), ...` in an array, and compute `f(n)` using a loop. This would eliminate the need to call `f(2)` twice while computing `f(4)`, for example. But you don't even need an array, you can compute `f(n)` using just two variables! Try it out.
