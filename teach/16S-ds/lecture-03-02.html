## Sorting Exercise

Find the exercises from last week in the pdf file `Recitation-Notes-02-24.pdf` on NYU Classes. The solutions that we ran through in class are in the file `Recitation-Notes-02-24-solutions.zip`.

## Merge Sort

[VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting) has a nice visual explanation of all the main sorting algorithms.

[Here](http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~courses/coe428/sorting/mergesort.html) is another useful merge sort animation.

## Quick Sort

http://me.dt.in.th/page/Quicksort/ has a nice explanation of quick sort. However, note that this page (and also VisAlgo) uses a different way of partitioning the array as compared to what are on the class slides. Both ways do the same thing and take roughly the same time. Be sure to look at the section titled "Picking the Pivot" to see how important it is to pick a pivot that is not too high or too low.

[Here](http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/animation/web/QuickSortPartition.html) is an animation that shows the partitioning as done by the code on the class slides.
